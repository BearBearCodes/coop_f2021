Isaac Cheng's repo for his 2B work term with Drs. Toby Brown, Joel Roediger, and Matt
Taylor

## `warmup` folder

Warm-up exercises just to become familiarized with the CANFAR system. WARNING:
CONTAINS EXTRAORDINARILY MESSY CODE!

## `packages` folder

Contains some useful packages. Compiled primarily for my own use, but if you are not
dissuaded by their (lack of) organization, feel free to use these as well.
