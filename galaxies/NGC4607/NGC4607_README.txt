SNR results for NGC 4607 using u-band Voronoi-binning as reference band
(from ../lookup_table/lookup_table.ipynb step 1)

N.B. "good bins/pixels" means bins/pixels with finite SNRs >= 30

----- Results for NGC4607 -----
Number of good pixels 386738 	Total number of pixels: 446223
Original number of bins: 21105
Number of unique bins: 21020 	Maximum bin number: 21104
Relative percentage of good bins: 99.59725183605781

SNR results for NGC 4607 using z-band Voronoi-binning as reference band
(from ../lookup_table/lookup_table.ipynb step 1)

N.B. "good bins/pixels" means bins/pixels with finite SNRs >= 30

----- Results for NGC4607 -----
Number of good pixels 381645 	Total number of pixels: 446223
Original number of bins: 43716
Number of unique bins: 27831 	Maximum bin number: 43715
Relative percentage of good bins: 63.66318967883613

CONCLUSION: use u-band as reference band for this galaxy
N.B. I have already duplicated + renamed u-band results as the default results to use
