Flag map did not mask out a foreground star in NGC 4216 (see RGB image).

In our custom colour-colour to mass-to-light ratio calibration, I manually masked out any g-z colours <= 0 as that
corresponds to the area around the foreground star.

For future work, it is definitely better to re-do the Voronoi binning with the foreground star manually masked out
(just be prepared for it to take a long time).
